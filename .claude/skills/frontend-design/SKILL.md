This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a distinctive but mild (not bold) aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an academic style. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?
- **Context** The main content of the app is the pdf itself, so ui should be modern and cohesive but not distract from the pdf

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. The key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, Vue, scss, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Academically-looking
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **General**: Try to always leverage nuxt ui's tools as well as tailwind 4, work without them only as last resort
- **Theming**: Always support semantic colors and respect light/dark theming
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use SCSS (for static) and CSS variables (for dynamic) for consistency. 

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like, clicheed color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds or generic green for main color).

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Elaborate designs need elaborate code to support them. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: Claude is capable of precise yet creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.
